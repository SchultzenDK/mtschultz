                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>
                        Use The Boost! is an Android game made in Godot, developed by me.<br>
                        It's free and without any forced ads.<br>
                        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NinjaPanda.UseTheBoost" target="_blank">Try it here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After many years of constantly prototyping big ideas, I wanted to actually finish a game.<br>
                        It had to be a game that I'd enjoy, and it had to be very small.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tools I used</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game itself was made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>.<br>
                        Godot is open source, which means it's also completely free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The graphics were made in <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>.<br>
                        A very fun and great pixel art tool.<br>
                        You could probably also just use MS Paint, if you want a free option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sounds were made in <a href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a> with <a href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum">Xfer Serum</a><br>
                        Ableton and Serum are both amazing, but also incredibly overkill for this project.<br>
                        You can easily create great retro game sounds, for free.<br>
                        I haven't played much with it, but check out <a href="https://sfxr.me/">jsfxr</a>.

                    <h2>Tricks</h2>
                    <p>
                        The spaceship never moves. I instead move the walls and the stars.<br>
                        This is so I avoid huge numbers, and so I can check the location of the walls, without basing it off of the spaceship.<br>
                        It also contains everything in the same position, which makes it a lot easier to work with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To give a sense of depth, I made some stars slower and some faster, to make it seem as if some are closer, and some are further.<br>
                        The really fast stars are given larger sprites, to further sell the idea of depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The length of the walls are set programically.<br>
                        You can very easily create repeating sprites in Godot, which enabled me to ensure that the game would look right, on any device, and not use overly large sprites.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Other notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        The hardest thing to implement, was AdMob. (advertisements)<br>
                        It gave me a lot of trouble, and at one point it would constantly either crash my game, or the engine.<br>
                        I moved the project into a new folder, and then it randomly started working correctly.<br>
                        Be sure to pay close attention to everything, when implementing AdMob.<br>
                        I used the <a href="https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Android-Admob-Plugin">plugin by Shin-NiL</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Google is very strict when it comes to targeting kids.<br>
                        Be sure to write "watch ad ..." on any button that activates an ad, or your app may be rejected.<br>
                        I learned that "watch video ..." is not good enough.<br>
                        And with that said, I think it's completely fair.
